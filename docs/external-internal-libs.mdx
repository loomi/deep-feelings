# External and Internal Libs

## Forms

For forms we use and recommend [Formik](https://formik.org). Formik is an extremely robust and feature-packed library, in addition to using great standards that allow developers to build their components on top of Formik's base components.

Our [Form](../src/components/Form) component is built on top of Formik and you can use it that way:

```jsx
type LoginValues = {
  email: string;
  password: string;
};

<Form<LoginValues>
  initialValues={{
    email: '',
    password: '',
  }}
  onSubmit={async (values) => {
    await login(values);
    onSuccess();
  }}
  validationSchema={schema}
  withDebugger
  >
  {() => (
    <>
      <FieldWrapper
        name="email"
        helper="Insert a valid email"
        required
        label="Email"
        as={(props) => <TextInput type="email" {...props} />}
      />
      <FieldWrapper
        name="password"
        helper="Insert a valid password"
        required
        label="Password"
        as={(props) => <TextInput type="password" {...props} />}
      />

      <Button type="submit" className="w-full">
        Log in
      </Button>
    </>
  )}
</Form>
```

All types of inputs are available [here](../src/components/Form/Fields), feel free to modify, create new ones and invent as you like.
## API Layer

Our APIs are always made with REST and we think [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) is the best library to handle this type of request. We use a strategy to configure an Axios instance and use this instance throughout the application, which allows us to have greater control and manage to handle the flow of our requests.

Our Axios configuration is available [here](../src/lib/axios.ts). In this instance we set things like:

- base URL
- Interceptors
- Access and Refresh token dealings

## State Management

Before talking about the libraries we use, it is important to emphasize the difference between State Management and Dependency Injenction.

### Dependency Injection

Usually, when your problem is to pass data from a parent component to more distant children in the tree, to not need to pass the props from child to child (Prop Drilling) the ideal is to use a Dependency Injection strategy. For this we can use:

- [ContextAPI](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) + [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
- [constate](https://github.com/diegohaz/constate)

### Client Global State

However, when your problem is actually storing states and having control over how it changes over time, then a state management library is recommended ~~please don't use Redux~~ like:

- [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)

Zustand is extremely minimalist and offers very simple strategies for state management.

### Server Global State

When dealing with state that is coming from an external resource, usually an API, there is a bunch of problems that we need to take care of

- fetching
- caching
- synchronizing
- updating server state
- and many more

There is a couple a libraries that can do this, but here we use [react-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/).
