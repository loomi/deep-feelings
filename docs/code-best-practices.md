# Code Best Practices

When we work with scalable projects, it's importante that we have a pattern in the implementation of our code and follow the best practices. To garantee that our code have a good quality, we need to analyse differents levels of our code.

## Clean Code

This is the most abstract level of code standardization. It's related to the implementations independent of the programming language. It will help the readability of your code.

## React

React is a framework that gives you the freedom to implement the various features in the way you prefer. This on the one hand is good because we are not stuck to a certain standard, but it also leaves room for us not to use its full potential and make mistakes that we don't know how to correct.

For this, it is important that we know the [Documentation](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

It is also important that we know the main [implementation patterns with the framework](reactpatterns.com/).
